<p> I was eight years old when I realized there was nothing more I wanted to be than a storyteller. The first few years of my life I was traveling back and forth from the Dominican Republic, to the United States. The influence that travel and language had on me led me to writing. In elementary I would sit on a stool and read a poem a day to the class. Through later years in middle school, writing crept up in my 10 minute warm ups. Iâ€™ve participated in competitions, writing for school magazines, Filming school shows, and Interning. Though my accomplishments have only further intensified my love for language, writing, culture, and children, I have a long way to go with storytelling. I am in love with memoir writing as it is the writing style I use most often. I am now a sophomore student at The New School University majoring in Journalism and Design. My aspirations of storytelling go beyond writing, and I hope to be able to minor in one of the visual art programs through my university."</p>
